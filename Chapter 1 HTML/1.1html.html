<h1>Chickens</h1>

<!-- As you can see, this is one level heading using h1 -->

I love <b>chickens.</b>

<!-- as you can see, b is the bold element think-->

<p>This is a sentence in a paragraph element tags.</p>
<!-- p element is the paragraph element where you can group things up here such as text, pics, and so on. -->

<h2>This is a sub-section that is smaller than h1</h2>

<!-- so h1 is the top heading level  -->
