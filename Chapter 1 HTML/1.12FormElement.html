<button>This is button that does nothing because it is outside form</button>
<!-- form is a container that that will be used for input like username and password -->

<!-- action is where data will be sent when form is submitted. It specifies where data should be sent -->

<!-- input is what goes inside the form -->

<!-- type obviously specifies the type of text -->

<!-- placeholder is used for username and password and other inputs that acts as placeholder until a user inputs something -->

<h1>bb</h1>

<!-- labels are good to have a like a text or something  that is associated wth an input-->

<!-- for them both to be connected, label's for value should be the same as input's id value -->


<!-- as you can see, the button submits the form based on the action thing -->

<!-- as you can see, when i specified the type as button, it does not make it submit the form and rather just acts like a useless button -->

<!-- as you can see, in inputs, when you have name = "", when you for example input your username, it will be saved in the name "variable" as you can see here when i press the button after inputting some stuff in the user name box
